This project involves creating a repository, pushing an existing folder into it, creating a new branch, making changes to the folder, and committing those changes to the new branch. The next step would be to merge the bugfix branch with the main default branch in order to ensure that all changes made in the bugfix branch are synced with the main branch. By pushing all changes from the main branch, there will be a successful push of all new changes come. Git merge will be used to unify various commit sequences into a single, cohesive history. The most popular method for joining two branches is git merge. In the examples that follow, this article will emphasize this branch merging pattern. Git merge will search for a shared base commit between two commit points in these circumstances, which are often the branch tips. Once it finds a common base commit, Git will create a new "merge commit" that contains the modifications of each pending merge commit sequence. In their git repository, the programmer primarily keeps a pristine master branch. They then create a copy of the master branch where they can keep their most current code updates, fix any mistakes, commit the changes, and perform a variety of additional tasks. This strategy entails just branching in the git structure. Users can use the git Branch command to create, remove, list, and rename branches. Branching is one of git's newest features for managing code version control. It shows the most recent version of your code without making any changes to the master branch. In this project, we constructed a python repository and incorporated the exercise folders from weeks 2-5. We need to create one git repository entitled Powershell, and this python repo will only have one default branch named main. Commit the folders and all files included within them; we use the command git init to initialize git in the folder where the project is to be pushed. After git init, we can use git add to add the contents of the folder to the git repo, git commit to commit all the files to the git repository, and finally push the folder contents to the git repository, which will automatically push the folder to the main branch. The image below depicts the pushed Powershell repository. Branch bugfix needs to be created and to change the branch we use git checkout command, this changes the branch to whcihever branch is created and is given, the branch creation can be done using git brnach -b branchname (bugfix). After branch creation use checkout command to change the branch from default main and then add and commit the changes made in the folder repo. Now to merge the changes made in bugfix branch use command git merge -b bugfix, this will merge the bugfix branch chanmges with the main branch and main branch will be synced with bugfix branch, then finally we can push it. Below image shows the creation of bugfix branch.
